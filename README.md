agiledox
=============

agiledox generates a simple documentation from junit4-Tests.  
It is the _junit4-Version_ of [agiledox](http://agiledox.sourceforge.net/).  
The documentation-style is inspired by spec tools (e.g. ruby-rspec). 

Installation
------------

Install clojure: (on OSX)

    brew install clojure

Check it out:

    git clone git://github.com/jenshimmelreich/agiledox.git

Let the line in the shellscript agiledox point to agiledox.clj.  
Put agiledox in your path.

Usage
-----

Go into the root-directory of a java-project.   
Run agiledox

    agiledox
